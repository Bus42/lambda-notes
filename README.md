# lambda-notes Notes

## Remember:
* submit button not needed - the idea is to autosave like evernote.


## To Do
 [ ] Fetch list of notes from db, populate notes
 [ ] Save changes (only fields that have changed) to db upon save (submit)
 [ ] Fetch again upon successfully saving changes
 [ ] Store auto-login info in local storage
 [ ] Store all changes for current session in session storage for redundancy in case of interrupted connection, clear on unmount
 [ ] Implement service worker so app can be used offline and synced when online - in cases of conflict use newest change.
 [ ] Implement login/auth (pw and pw-less)
 [ ] Keep ```textarea``` size in Note state
 [ ] Create relational database
 [ ] Add class categories to notes, accessible via expanding bubble
